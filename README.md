# TC19 Optimal Territory Planning with Tableau #TableauSalesOps
8/3/2024 Update : With the increasing prevalance of Apple M1 + M2 chips at work, I've updated the libraries to those which are ARM compatible and increased documentation for the Command Line version. If you are experiencing issues with the GUI on Mac, check the .txt file for instructions on how to resolve references to old Tkinter installs. 

6/10/2020 Update : I've posted a new folder "python" where a python implementation of the territory clustering tool has been released. 
                   There is a file for those would be prefer a GUI, and one that presents a command line version as well. Documentaiton is                    light at the moment, but I hope to provide some with time. Feel free to reach out to me (contact info in files) if you                    have questions or feedback.  TabPy support is also in the planning, but may be a ways out, given other commitments.
