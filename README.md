8/22/2024 Update : I've heard feedback through the years from users who have a very locked down environment on their work machines and have struggled with downloading all the necessary software to run the territory clustering tool. In response to those issues, I've launched a simple, free webapp for general use. You can find it at this URL https://streamlit-cluster-5wfo3fqbaq-uw.a.run.app/

Please send me any feedback you have!

8/3/2024 Update : With the increasing prevalance of Apple M1 + M2 chips at work, I've updated the libraries to those which are ARM compatible and increased documentation for the Command Line version. If you are experiencing issues with the GUI on Mac, check the .txt file for instructions on how to resolve references to old Tkinter installs. 

6/10/2020 Update : I've posted a new folder "python" where a python implementation of the territory clustering tool has been released. 
                   There is a file for those would be prefer a GUI, and one that presents a command line version as well. Documentation is                    light at the moment, but I hope to provide some with time. Feel free to reach out to me (contact info in files) if you                    have questions or feedback.  TabPy support is also in the planning, but may be a ways out, given other commitments.
