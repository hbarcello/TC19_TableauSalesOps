# TC19 Optimal Territory Planning with Tableau #TableauSalesOps
6/10/2020 Update : I've posted a new folder "python" where a python implementation of the territory clustering tool has been released. 
                   There is a file for those would be prefer a GUI, and one that presents a command line version as well. Documentaiton is                    light at the moment, but I hope to provide some with time. Feel free to reach out to me (contact info in files) if you                    have questions or feedback.  TabPy support is also in the planning, but may be a ways out, given other commitments.
