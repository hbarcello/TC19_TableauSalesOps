Installation instructions for using the python desktop clustering tool

Step 1)
Download and install python 3.11 if you do not already have it on your PC or Mac.

Step 2)
Download this git project and unzip to a directory of your choice

Step 3)
Open a command line terminal (mac or pc) and navigate to the \python folder where you unzipped the project. You should see a 'requirements.txt' file located there.

Step 4)
Run the following command in that directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required python packages for use with this program.

Step 5a)
NOTE : The GUI version may require extra work to run on Apple hardware (see below)
The GUI typically works well out of the box with windows

from the command line (or terminal) type

python3 tabClusterGUI.py

a GUI interface should appear where you can navigate to a .csv file to execute clustering on.
The example template of what an input file should look like is located at
python/test/example_input_cluster.csv 

Mac Only : Depending on your local configuration, you may need to perform extra steps to ensure your python environment
is using the correct version of Tkinter. If you are using the outdated, built in system verion of Tkinter you will see
errors. I would recommend using PyEnv to install the latest version of Tkinter and ensure it is appropriately referenced
in a virtual environment.

env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-tcltk-includes='-I/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/include' --with-tcltk-libs='-L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib -ltcl8.6 -ltk8.6'" pyenv install 3.11.9


Step 5b) [All Platforms]
In the command line terminal, within the python folder, you can execute a command line clustering with the following syntax

python3 tabClusterCMD.py --ClusterInputFile <File Location - No Quotes> --outputLocation <File output path and name, no quotes, .xlsx extension>
